# Full Stack Todo List Project with Advanced Log In and Sign Up Features

This is a full-featured **To-Do List web application** built with React on the frontend and connected to a backend server for data persistence (can be PHP, Node.js, or any backend). Users can **sign up**, **log in**, and manage their personal task list with ease.

### 🚀 Features

- User authentication (sign up & log in)
- Protected routes to restrict access without logging in
- Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete
- Responsive UI built with **Tailwind CSS**
- Data stored in a backend (e.g., using API and database)
- Clean and modern design
- Easy to customize and extend

This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://github.com/rifatxtra/react-tailwind-template).
